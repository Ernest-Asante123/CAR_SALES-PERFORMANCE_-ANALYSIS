# CAR_SALES-PERFORMANCE_-ANALYSIS
Car Sales Performance Analysis using Excel (Pivot Tables &amp; Dashboard)
**
Project Summary

This project delivers a performance-driven analysis of multi-regional car sales data to identify revenue concentration patterns, geographic demand distribution, and dealer productivity disparities.

The objective was to transform raw transactional sales data into a structured analytical model capable of supporting strategic decision-making and operational optimization.

The final deliverable includes an interactive dashboard enabling dynamic Top-N analysis and performance benchmarking.

 **Business Problem**
 

Management required visibility into:

Revenue concentration across automotive companies

Regional variations in sales demand

Dealer-level performance contribution

Strategic areas for growth and operational improvement

The challenge was to extract actionable insights from raw sales records and present them in a structured decision-support format.


**Methodology & Analytical Approach**
**Data Preparation & Structuring**

Standardized categorical variables (brand/company names)

Validated revenue fields and corrected inconsistencies

Built a structured pivot-based aggregation model

Implemented dynamic filtering mechanisms using slicers

**Revenue Concentration Analysis (Top-N Modeling)**

Applied value-based ranking to identify:

Top 5 revenue-generating companies

Revenue distribution hierarchy

Competitive clustering among leading firms

 Insight:
Revenue is highly concentrated among a limited number of companies, indicating potential pricing power and strong brand positioning within the market.

**Regional Sales Performance Benchmarking**

Regions were ranked by total car sales volume to determine:

High-demand geographic markets

Underperforming territories

Sales density distribution

 Insight:
Significant regional variance suggests the need for localized inventory planning and targeted marketing strategies.

**Dealer Productivity Evaluation**

Conducted performance benchmarking of the Top 5 dealers based on revenue contribution.


**Dashboard Capabilities**

The final Excel dashboard includes:

Dynamic Top-5 revenue visualization

Region-based sales ranking

Dealer performance leaderboard

Interactive slicer controls for filtering by brand and region

Real-time recalculation of performance metrics

This simulates a lightweight Business Intelligence environment within Excel.

**Key Strategic Insights**

Revenue concentration suggests dependency on a limited number of high-performing companies.

Geographic demand imbalance presents market expansion opportunities.

Dealer performance disparities indicate operational efficiency gaps.

Revenue-to-volume comparison suggests variation in pricing strategies across companies.


**Strategic Recommendations**

Allocate higher inventory to high-demand regions to maximize turnover.

Develop performance benchmarking framework across dealer network.

Replicate operational practices of top-performing dealers.

Introduce targeted marketing campaigns in underpenetrated regions.

Further analyze customer segmentation to support pricing optimization.
